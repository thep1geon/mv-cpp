[X] Move arg system over to std::vector instead of my very flawed 
    linked list

[X] Pass values with function call ?(and ret)?
    ~ call Add 23 34
    ~ func Add:
    ~   ~ STACK: 23 34 (top)
    ~   ~ add
    ~   ~ ret

        I can't think of any reason to add this feature
        but maybe there was a reason I thought of this
        ~ func a:
        ~   ~ call Add . 32
        ~   ~ ret .

        I found no reason to add this feature

[X] Variables - more like "binding"?
    ~ set x 42
    ~ #set y x+32 # Can't do that 
    ~ # You have to do this instead
    ~ call Add x 32 
    ~ pop y

[X] "Pipe" operator to catch the top item of the stack
    ~ set x 42
    ~ # I want to increment x by 10
    ~ # But I'd have to do this:
    ~ # call Add x 10
    ~ # pop x
    ~ # I can simplify and do this instead
    ~ call Add x 10 | x
    ~ # The pipe will take the top of the stack after
    ~ # the Add function and set x to that value
    ~ str "Hello World" | str_ptr # Would also work too

[X] Escape Character Support

[ ] Preprocess the include instruction
    We can process the include instruction during compile time rather than
    runtime. This would let the included file run code and include other 
    files without having to do any stupid hacks with labels and functions
