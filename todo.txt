[X] Move arg system over to std::vector instead of my very flawed 
    linked list

[X] Pass values with function call ?(and ret)?
    ~ call Add 23 34
    ~ func Add:
    ~   ~ STACK: 23 34 (top)
    ~   ~ add
    ~   ~ ret

        I can't think of any reason to add this feature
        but maybe there was a reason I thought of this
        ~ func a:
        ~   ~ call Add . 32
        ~   ~ ret .

        I found no reason to add this feature

[X] Variables - more like "binding"?
    ~ set x 42
    ~ #set y x+32 # Can't do that 
    ~ # You have to do this instead
    ~ call Add x 32 
    ~ pop y

[X] "Pipe" operator to catch the top item of the stack
    ~ set x 42
    ~ # I want to increment x by 10
    ~ # But I'd have to do this:
    ~ # call Add x 10
    ~ # pop x
    ~ # I can simplify and do this instead
    ~ call Add x 10 | x
    ~ # The pipe will take the top of the stack after
    ~ # the Add function and set x to that value
    ~ str "Hello World" | str_ptr # Would also work too

[X] Escape Character Support
